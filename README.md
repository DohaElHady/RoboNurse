# Robot Nurse Assistant
This repository aims to introduce a simplfied version of code for a Robo-Nurse asistant, which designed to give a third and forth hands to all medical staff sections in hospitals. Doctors, nurses, pharmacy, and patients, all are connected through one single system. 
RONA, the Robo-Nurse Assistant, is an autonomous robot that is designed to ease up the patients checkup process for some sections in the hospital as cardio, post anesthesia care unit, and infection control unit specially for the hospitals that can’t afford buying a care unit for each single room in it. All achieved with the integrated medical sensors inside RONA as Max30102 Spo2 Sensor, MLX90614 IR Temprature Sensor, and ECG Module. RONA was designed to be a Real Time Operating System, that has direct contact to the cloud and thus to a mobile application, through which the doctors and nurses can schedule and access the patients’ checkups results. 
The project is based on Python programming language.
The repository includes various libraries downloaded from Github besides the main code in "MainCode" file.
