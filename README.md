# Robot Nurse Assistant
This repository aims to introduce a simplfied version of code for a Robo-Nurse asistant, which designed to give a third and forth hands to all medical staff sections in hospitals. Doctors, nurses, pharmacy, and patients, all are connected through one single system. 
RONA, the Robo-Nurse Assistant, is an autonomous robot that is designed to ease up the patients checkup process for some sections in the hospital as cardio, post anesthesia care unit, and infection control unit specially for the hospitals that can’t afford buying a care unit for each single room in it. 
The repository includes various libraries downloaded from Github and used in the project, besides the main code in "MainCode" file.
